# Monsters Rolodex
A simple project to learn React + TypeScript

## Details

- Very simple project using CRA as boilerplate
- Intially created with JS, then converted to TypeScript

Extra: course didn't explain how to handle a fetch error, so I researched and did it myself, addying a try/catch with TS, and conditional rendering so the page doesn't break if fetch fails.
